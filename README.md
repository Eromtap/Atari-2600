# Atari-2600
Repo containing my journey through learning 6502(6507) assembly language

Requires DASM assembler to be installed.
Running binary files requires emulator. I prefer Stella emulator, but 8bitworkshops Javatari is a good browser based emulator.

TODO:
  add instructions for building and running binaries.
